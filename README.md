# portfolio

This is my portfolio webpage which I built from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

My intention for this project was to showcase my love for simple layouts, clean aesthetics and user friendly design. I aimed for a very minimalist colour scheme with the use of bright green as an accent.

My planning phase started with identifying the sections I wanted my portfolio to consist of: 

- Hero section
- About Me
- Projects
- Contact form

The next task was to decide how to present the relevant information in each section in a way that is both logical and visually appealing.

I kept the layout super basic (close to default) but also tried to use as much padding as possible. I attempted to keep animations and transitions to a bare minimum.

At first my project data was hard-coded into the HTML file but my most recent change to the site was to add a function which pulls this data from a JSON file instead. This makes it much easier to update my portfolio in the future.
